# ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Financial Projects

This repository is the **successor and complement** to [Financial-Projects](https://github.com/KilianVoillaume/Financial-Projects), with a focus on **more advanced, research-driven, and technically sophisticated projects**.

While *Financial-Projects* covers foundational and intermediate-level tools for understanding financial markets, this repository explores **more complex models, strategies, and implementations**, aimed at deepening expertise and addressing more challenging problems in quantitative finance and trading.

Stay tuned as new projects are added regularly.
